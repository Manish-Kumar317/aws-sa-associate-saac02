VPC Flow Logs
    *  VPC FLow logs is a feature allowing the monitoring of traffic flow to and from interfaces within a VPC
    * PC Flow logs can be added at a VPC, Subnet or Interface level.
    * Flow Logs DON'T monitor packet contents ... that requires a packet sniffer.
    * Flow Logs can be stored on S3 or CloudWatch Logs

Egress-Only Internet Gateway
    * Why do we need
        * IPv4 add are public and private
        * NAT allows private IPs to access public networks
        * NAT is limited to IPv4
        * IGW (IPv6) allows all IN and OUT network. To overcome this we use E-O IGW
    * AZ resellient
    * Arch same as IGW
VPC Endpoints
    * Gateway 
        * Provide private access to s3 and DynamoDB 
        * Provide private access to AWS public SERVICES
        * Created per servcie per region in one or more subnets in a VPC
        * PREFIX LIST IS ADDED TO THE ROUTE TABLE FOR THE ASSOCIATED SUBNETS
        * HA across all AZs in aregion by default. Region resellient
        * Endpoint Policy is used to control what it can access
            * Like restrict it to particular s3 bucket and not the entire s3 service
        * REGIONAL can access cross region services
        * Prevent Leaky bukcets
            * Like only allow via the gateway endpoint and rest would be implicitly denied
        * It cannot be accessed by outside of the VPC it is associated with
    * Interface Endpoints
        *  Provide private access to AWS Public Services EXCEPT S3 and Dynamo DB
        * Added to specific subnets - an ENI - not HA. No HA by default
        * For HA - 
            * one endpoint , one subnet per AZ
        * Network access by Secuity groups. GE do not use that
        * Endpoint Policies
        * ONLY TCP and IPv4
        * Uses PrivateLink
        * USES DNS FOR ENDPOINT
            * Reginonal DNS - Can be resolved all over the VPC
            * Zonal DNS - Can be resolved within the same zone
        * PrivateDNS
            * Associates Private r53 zone with the private IP of service endpoint
            * Override the default service

AWS VPC Peering - 
    * Direct encrypted link between TWO VPC
    * same/cross-region same/cross-account
    * public dns hostname to resolve the private IPs 
    * Same region can SG's can reference peer SGs
    * NOT supports transitive peering (VPCA<->VPCB<->VPCC. Does not mean VPC A can connect to VPC C).
    * VPC CIDR cannot be overlapped
