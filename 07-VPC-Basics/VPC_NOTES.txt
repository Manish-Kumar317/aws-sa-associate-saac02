Default
    * Some services can behave oddly if default VPC is not created
    * Once deleted default VPC can be recreated
VPC Sizing
    * Size?
    * other networks, cloud vendors and other things
    * Reserve atleast 2+ VPC Cidr in one region
    * AWS Ideal CIDR prefix
        * micro - /24
        * small - /21
        * medium - /19
        * large - /18
        * XL - /16
    * How many subnets
        * recommendation
            * 3 AZ and one spare. 4
            * 3 teir(UI,backend,DB) and one spare. 4
            * 4*4 = 16 subnets
    * Can add secondary CIDR blocks and remove it afterwards
Custom VPC
    * default or dedicated tenancy - Create VPC on shared hardware or dedicated hardware
    * IPv4 private and public IPs 
    * 1 primary private CIDR
    * Min /28 max /16
    * Optional single assigned IPv6 /56 CIDR Block
    * DNS in VPC
        * By Route 53
        * DNS IP would be BASEIP + 2. So for 10.0.0.0 the DNS IP would be 10.0.0.2
        * enableDNSHostnames - IF public IP is created create a public DNS for it
        * enableDNSsupport - Enable DNS resolution within VPC
    subnets
        * 1 subnet cane only be in only in AZ. A AZ can have 0 or more subnets
        * 5 reserved IPs within a subnet
            * Network address or the starting address of the subnet (10.16.16.0)
            * Network+1 for VPC router (10.16.16.1)
            * Network+2 for DNS (10.16.16.2)
            * Netwokr+3 reserved for future (10.16.16.3)
            * Broadcast address (10.16.31.255)
        * DHCP applied at VPC level - used for IP addr allocation
        * Auto assign Public IPv4
        * Auto assign IPv4

VPC Router
    * Network+1 address
    * Routes traffic b/w subnets
    * Controlled by route tables
    * Every VPC has a main route table - subnet default
    * A subnet can only be associated with one route table but a route table can be associated with multiple subnets
    * A destination in route table can be an IP or a network range with prefix
    * Higher the prefix , higher the priority when multiple routes are available.
        *** But a local or default route takes priority
Internet Gateway (IGW)
    * Region resellient gateway attached to a VPC
    * A VPC can have one or 0 IGW
    * AN IGW can only be attached to VPC
    * AWS manages Performance
    * process
        * Create IGW
        * Attach it to VPC
        * Create custom RT
        * Associate RT
        * Default routes(0.0.0.0./0,::/0) to IGW
    * An IPv4 public address to EC2 instance is not configured on the instance but a record is maintained by IGW
NACL
    * Created by default by VPC each for all subnets
    * Applicable only for subnets
    * Instances within the subnet is not Applicable
    * Every rule in nacl get its number and priority is given to the lowest number. * is default number for deny all and will be the last rule
    * By default the all traffic will be allowed for both inbound and outbound
    * Default DENYALL cannot be removed at all
    * Both inbound and outbound needs to be created
    * Response are sent on ephemeral ports

------ Exam POWER UP -------------------
* NACL are stateless. Rules needs to be added for both request and response
* NACL only effects only if traffic crosses network subnet border
* Can explicitly ALLOw and eplixitly DENYALL
* No visibility for AWS resources
* only be applicable to subnets
* USE NETWORK ACL to explixitly DENY a specific IP (Bad IP)
* One subnet = One NACL
------------------------------------------

Security Groups
 * Applied to a Network Interface
 * Default Implicit Deny but no explixit DENY

 ------------ Exam Powerup -----------
 * SG is stateful
 * NO EXPLICIT DENY
 * NACL mostly for NAT or to Explicitly DENY
 ----------------------------

 NAT
    * IP Masquerading - Hiding CIDR blocks behind one IP
    * Only outgoing internet access
    * Uses Elastic IP (Static public IP)
    * AZ resellient service only (HA in that AZ only)
    * For region reseliency, WE have to create NAT in each AZ
    * Upto 45 Gbps
    * Charged hourly for base and charged hourly for data processing
    * A NAT GW is to be created in public subnet and traffic from private network is forwarded to this NAT GW
    * A NAt then forwards it to the IGW
    * NAT does not have a SG it only has NACL
    * NAT does not work with IPv6
    * IGW will be used fo IPv6
