LB
------ Exam Power UP -------------
    * Clinets connect to a listener on the LB
    * Listener connection - client to listener
    * Backend connection - listener to backend target
    * Used for HA, FT and scaling
----------------------------------

ALB 
    * Layer 7  - undersands HTTP/S
    * Scalable and available
    * Internet facnig or internal
    * Hourly and LCU(Load Capacity unit) per hour
    * Cross zone load balancing

---- Exam Power UP --------------
    * Targets(lambda, ec2) are under target groups
    * Rules are host based or path based
    * ALB can use SNI for multiple SSL certs 
    * Recommedned vs CLB
-------------------

Launch configuration and Launch Templates
    * Allows you to define the ec2 configuration in advance 
    * AMI, key pair, storage
    * immutable
    * LT Recommedned over LC. LT is newer

Auto scaling
    * Uses Launch templates and configuration
    * Has a Minimum Desired and MAximum size
    * Provision or terminate instacnes  
    * Scaling based on metrics
    * Attempts to keep the instances even
    * Scaling policies
        * Manual
        * Scheduled
        * Dynamic
            * Simple - "CPU above 50% + 1 ". Based on metric
            * Stepped - Simple + more control. Scale 1 if 50 + or 2 if 70+
            * Target Tracking - Desired Aggregrate. Constant resources if the load increases or decreases

    * Cooldown periods
        - Time to wait after scaling before performing another scaling
    * Ability to integrate with ALB
    * Use ALB for abstraction
    * ASG define WHEN and WHERE, LT defines WHAT to launch

NLB
    * Layer 4
    * Low latency
    * million of requests per second
    * static IP address
    * elastic IP 
    * SSL passthrough
SSL offload and session stickiness
    * Bridging 
        * Listener is configured for HTTPS
        * Connection is terminated on the ELB and needs a certificate for the domain
        * AWS mght be aware of the certificates
        * Coonections to Ec2 instances again as encrypted
        * Decrypt and then send again encrypt
    * passthrough
        * Just passes
        * No decryption
        * Instance needs to have the SSL certificate
    * offload
        * Terminated on the loadbalancer
    * Session stickiness
        * 1s to 7 days
        * can create uneven load
        * Recommedned to keep this logic outside of the aws
