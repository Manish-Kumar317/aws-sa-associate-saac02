Problems of virtualization
    * need an hypervisor and each vm needs it own os

ECS 
    * Managed container based compute service
    * Runs on docker engine
    * Container Definition
        * Registry
        * Ports
    * Task Definition
        * Task role (secuirty)
        * CPU, Memory
    * Service Definition
        * Scale tasks. HA
        * Define a load balancer in front of service definition

ECS Cluster Types
    * Components
        * Scheduling and orchestration
        * ClusterManager
        * Placement Engine
    * Clsuter types
        * EC2 model
            * Uses VPC
            * EC2 instances , Multi AZ ,SG 
            * Need to manage the underlying ec2 instances
        * Fargate
            * Serverless
            * Shared infra
            * Into the VPC
            * Its given an Elatic netowrk interface
            * No need to manage hosts
EC2 vs ECS vs Fargate
    * Containers use ECS
    * Large worklaod  - price consicius - Ec2
    * Large workload  - overhead consicius - Fargate
