Rules for overlapping
    * Explicit deny
    * Explicit allow unless explict deny
    * Default implicit Deny except the root user

Type of policies
    * Inline Policy - same individual policy is attached to individual users seperately 
    * Managed Policy - same policy commonly attached to individual users

IAM user
    * A single user or entity acting as a single principal

---exam power up-------
    * 5000 iam users per account
    * an iam user can only be part of 10 groups

IAM groups
    * Cannot login as a groups
    * Only to organise users
    * An IAM user can be part of multiple IAM groups
    * Cannot have nested groups
    * No built in groups
    * All 5k users can be added to a group
    * Groups cannot be REFERENCED on the reosurce policy

IAM roles
    * 
    * IAM role is best suited to be used for unknown principals for a temp purpose
    * It does not represent a user, account but the level of Permissions
    * A IAM role can only be assumed
    * USer is for long term but role is for short term
    * Role get a temporary token from AWS STS (Secure Token Service) sts:AssumeRole
    * Types of IAM Policy
        * Trust policy - Either users or reousrces in the same account or diff account
        * Permission policy
    * Use cases
        * An AWS service rather than giving access tokens
        * An emergency role during a break glass scenario
        * SSO or >5K users
        * Web identity federation
AWS Organizations
    * One management account handling zero or multiple accounts
    * Can create organizational units which can hold multiple AWS accounts
    * Consolidate Billing
    * Service Control Policies
        * Management account is unaffected by SCP 
        * SCP can restrict permissions for account root user** by restricting what an account can do 
          but otherwise you cannot restrict the permsiions of root account user
        * They do not grant permissions they just imit the permmissions
        * 
    * Works great with AWS SSO
CloudWatch
    * Regional service
    * Log are sent to stream
    * Log group are log streams
    * Metrics and renetenction permissions are done at log group

CloudTrail
    * Logs API calls account event as CloudTrail Event
    * regional service and All region
    * Global service events are logged to NVG
    * Logs managment event and data events(only if enabled)
----EXam Power Up--------
    * Cloud trail is enables by Default. with retention of 90 days no s3
    * Trails are how you configure s3 and CLW Logs
    * Managment events only by default
    * IAM , STS and Cloud fronts are global services and are logged to NVG
    * Not realtime
