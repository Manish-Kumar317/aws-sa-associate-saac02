Architecute
    * Monolith
    * Tier Based
    * Queue Based
        * Requests are sent to Queue
        * If the queue is long instances can be scaled accordingly or vice versra
        * Based on the queue lenghth the instances can scale in or scale out
    * Miicroservice
        * Consumer 
        * producer
        * both
    * Event driven
        * Event producer - when an event occurs
        * Event Consumer
        * Both
        * Event router
            * Events are sent to event router  and then it sends to Event Bus
            * Event Bus
            * which consumer it needs to deliver
LAmbda
    * Function as a service
    * Event driven invocation
    * LAmbda Function
    * Use a runtime like python, java and node.js
    * Only billed for the duration the function runs
    * Key component of serverless architecture
    * A function should be written in python
    * Recources allocation
        * Memory we will allocate and the CPU will be allocated accrodingly by AWS
    * Execution role (IAM role but attached to the Lambda function)
    * Stricly STATELESS
        * Unless
            * you can push data to other services like db or s3
        * beacuse
            * underlying host storage is temp
    * Can access internet 
    * 15 minute execution limit
    * Concurrency limit - 1000 concurrent execution per Region
        * reserved Concurrency
        * Provisioned Concurrency
********** Exam Power up ------------
    * Limit to 15 minutes
    * New runtime environment for each execution
    * Use excution role to give permission for other services
    * RUNTIME IS NOT PERSISTANT . USE OTHER PRODUCTS
    * Free -tier elgible.

Cloud watch events and Events Bridge
    * CWE
        * log events within AWS
    * EventBridge
        * Superset of CWE
        * CWE 2.0
    * If x happens or at and y time(s) do z
    * Both use a default bus for the account
    * CWE there is only one bus and not exposed on the UI 
    * EB can create more bridges
    * Rules match incoming events or sechedule
    * Process
        * When an state of a service changes(ec2) it creates and event and sedns to default event bus
        * Event bridge monitors this default event bus and rules are used to pattern match or time match(cron)
        * Rules are present in the event bridge either on a schedule or a pattern. This rule can trigger a event to a target like svc like lambda

API Gatweway
    * Mananged API Endpoint service
    * Create , Publish , Monitor and secure APIs as a service
    * Billed based on Number of API Calls , Data trasnfer and additional performance features
    * Both for legacy and modern
    * Regional Service

Serverless Architecture
    * Isn't one single thing
    * You manage few if any server - low overhead
    * Beyond microservices - fucntions
    * Stateless and ephemeral - duration billing
    * FaaS
    * Event driven
    * If not used should be zero cost
    * Managed serviced wherever possible
    * Example
Simple Notification service (SNS)
    * Public service
    * Pub sub message
    * Co-ordinates for sending and delivery of messages
    * Messages are <= 256KB payloads
    * A publisher sends message to a topic
    * A topic can be subscribed
    * A producer generate messages and a subscriber recieves the message
    * A filter can be applied at subscriber level to recieve required messages
    * Capabilites
        * Delivery status
        * Delivery retries
        * HA and scalable region ressilient service
        * Server side encryption

Step fucntions
    * JSON-based Amazon States Language.
    * To overcome desgin limitations of lambda
        * Lambda is FaaS
        * Max 15 minutes for lambda
        * Run environments are stateless
    * We can create state machines
    * States are things which can occurs
        * Start - STATE - end
    * Maximum 1 year
    * Standard Workflow
        * Maximum 1 year
    * Express Workflow
        * 5 minutes
        * High transcational volumes like IOT 
    * IAM role for permissions
    * States   
        * Succeed and fail
        * Wait - certian period of time or specifc time. Holds the processing
        * Choice - Take a different path based on bheaviour
        * Parallel - perform multiple stuff based on the Choice
        * Map - A list of order. For each order it performs a action
        * Task - A single unit of work performed by a service (lamda, batch, ECs, SNS, SQS)

Simple Queue Service
    * Types
        * Standard 
            * best effort. no order gurantee
            * at least once. may be twice or more
            * like four lane highway
        * FIFO
            * Send and recieved data in order
            * exactly once
            * like single lane highway
            * 3000 messages per second batching and 300 messages without batching
        * Maximum 256KB
        * Recieved messages are hidden (Visibility timeout)
            * Client needs to delete the message or else after VT the messages will reappear to processed by a different client
        * Dead letter Queue - can be used for problematic messages
        * Billed on requests
        * Less efficent for most frequesnt uses
        * Polling
            * Short - constantly polls the queue. consumes a request even if the queue size is zero
            * Long (waitTimeSeconds)- Polls and wait for the mssages to arrive. Recommended
            * Encrytpition at rest and transit
        * Delay Queues - 15 minutes

Kinesis (like Kafka)
    * Streaming sservice
    * Lots of data and lots of devices
    * Data is available for 24 hours. Can be increased to 7 days
    * Multiple producers and multiple consumers
    * Kinesis Data streams
    * Kinesis analytics
    * Kinesis video streams    
    * Kinesis firehose
        * Put data into something like s3
SQS vs Kineis
    * SQS   
        * 1production group and 1 consumption group
        * Decouppling and async commn
        * No persistance of messages
    * Kinesis
        * Huge scale ingestion
        * Multiple consumers
        * Monitoring,analystic,ingestion

Amazon Cognito
    * Authentication,authorization and user managment for web/mobile apps
    * User pools
        * Sign in and get a JWT 
        * WEb UI for sigin 
        * MFA
        * Phone and email verification
        * Also by other identity providors
        * CANNOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE AWS SERVICES
    * Identity pools
        * Allow temp access to aws services by giving temp aws credentials
