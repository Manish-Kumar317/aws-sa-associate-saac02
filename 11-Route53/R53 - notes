Hosted zones
    * DNS DB(zone file) for a Domain
    * Globally reselient
Public Hosted Zones
    * Zone file hosted by 4 name servers
    * Resource records are created under within hosted zone
    * The nameservers is in aws public zone and can be resolved by external traffic
    * The VPC+2 IP can resolve this zone using r53 resolver
Private Hosted Zone
    * Public hosted zone but isn't public
    * Only within VPC within different accounts
    * Split view - same zone name for public and private name
        * some records can be private and and some can be public
CNAME vs Alias
    * Problem
        * Cname maps Name to Name
        * CNAME cannot be created for APEX domain or naked domain (vcsgreenbox.com)
    * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html
    * Use ALIAS records only with AWS services
        * API Gateway cloudfront beanstalk ELB Global Accelrator and S3
    * A CNAME record cannot be created for domain apex but alias reord can be created
Simple routing
    * When want to route reqests to one webserver
    * Does not support health checks
R53 Health checks
    * Are seperate from r53 records. Created outside of r53 records
    * Globally located
    * Can check any AWS endpoint or any public IP
    * Health checkers every 30 seconds
    * TCP, HTTP, HTTPS with string Matching (Body of the response)
Failover routing
    * A second record is created for the same record
    * If the primary health check fails then it is routed to 
Multivalue routing
    * Mixture of simple nd Failover
    * Many records with same name
    * each record can have health checks
    * When queried 8 healthy records are returned
    * NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR LOAD BALANCING
Weighted routing
    * SIMPLE LOAD BALANCNG OR TESTING NEW SOFTWARE versions
    * Each record can be returned based on weight vs total weight
    * Adding weights on records to give priority based on weights
    * A 0 record means it is never returned until all the other records are weighted 0
    * A unhealthy weighted record can be skipped
Latency based routing
    * Better performance
    * Region record is used
    * One record with same name in each region
Geolocation routing
    * Geolocation records
        * us state
        * country
        * continent
        * default
    * Does not return closest record it only retruns any which is applkicable
    * Restrict content to specifc region
    * Launage based pages
    * NOT CLOSEST ONLY RELEVANT RECORDS
    * Only return recors if the location is RELEVANT
GEO-PROXIMITY RECORDS
    * Provide record within the closest location (distance)
    * A plus or minus bias can be added to the record to increase the coverage area
    * for Eg     
        * Austrailia having large bias (+) can cover saudi if uk region is on low bias (refer images)

Route53 interporability
    * r53 can do domain registrar and domain hosting
    * Domain registration and hosting
        * accepts fees 
        * creaes 4 name servers
        * create a zone file on the above ns 
        * create a record for ns in top level domain
    * domain reg Only
        * domain reg is by r53
        * domain ns hosting is on external like go daddy
    * hosting Only
        * opp of domsin reg
        * ns by aws
        * domain reg by external
