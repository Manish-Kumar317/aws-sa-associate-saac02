Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 101
    * Lets router exchange network information 
    * Autonomous ssytems (AS) - Routers controlled by one entity 
    * Operates over tcp/179
    * BGP needs to be manually created between two AS
    * BGP is a path vector protocol it excahnges the best path to a destination between peers. This path is called ASPAT
AWS Site to Site VPN
    * A logical connection between VPc and on-premise, encrupted running over the public internet
    * Full Ha - If you design and implement it correctly
    * Quick to provision - less than hour
    * Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) - Two endpoints in diff AZ
    * Customer Gateway (CGW)
    * VPN Connection between the VGW and CGW
    * Process refer diagram
        * VGW creates two endpoint to make it Ha
        * Tunnel from each endpoint is opened to op prem Customer Gateway
        * To make the on prem HA,  
            * Add additional CGW and create one more VPN connection
        * Static vs Dynamic VPN
            * Static - Uses static routes and statically configured VPN connection
            * Static - Missing Load balancing and mutli connection failover
            * Dynamic - Uses BGP protocol. Provided Multiple VPN
            * Dynamic - Supports Route propogation
                            * If the VGW gets aware of the any network it will add to the routes automatically
            * Limitations
                * 1.25 Gbps Exam power UP
                * Latency - inconsistent , public internet
                * Cost - AWS hourly cost, GB out cost, data cap (on premises)
                * Speed of setup - hours or less coz all software configuration
                * Can be backup for Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect
    * A 1Gbps(1000-Base-LX) or 10 Gbps(!0gBase-LR) port 
    * Port are located in DX location
    * Only port would be given and rest is handled by customer
    * Multiple Virtual Interfaces (VIFS) over one DX
    * Private VIF(VPC) and Public VIF(Public zone services)
    * Takes longer very longer than VPN
    * Dx Port provisioning is quick...the cross connect takes longer
    * May be first provision VPN and then DX
    * Faster 40 Gbps with Agregation
    * Low consistent Latency
    * NO Encryption

AWS Transit Gateway
    * Network Transit Hub to connect VPC to on premisies networks
    * Reduces network complexity
    * HA ans scalable
    * Attachaments to other networks
    * VPC, Site-to-Site VPN & Direct Connect Gateway
    * TRANSITIVE
        * Create site to site VPN from TGW to CGW
        * Then all the VPC connected to TGW can connect to CGW and also among themselves
        * TGW can be peered with other TGW

            * File storage backed by s3
            * SGW provied SMB ad NFS to the client and then the files are stored as s3 objects
            * Provides active directory
        * Volume Modes
            *  Gateway cached and stored (iSCCI)
            * Uses and backed by s3 and EBS snapshots
            * The storage is local but the backups are stored in s3 as ebs snapshots
            * stored
                * Primararly used for DR and snapshots 
                * The data is on local and only backup is taken by AWS
            * cached
                * The primaryy data is stored in AWS
                * Only cached data is stored into AWS
