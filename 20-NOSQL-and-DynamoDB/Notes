Dynamo Databases
    * NoSql
    * Public Database as a Service
    * Key,Value
    * No self managed or infra reqiured to manage
    * Provisioned performance or onDemand
    * HA, across AZs and optionally Global
    * More like Table as a service
    * Items inside Table
    * Item max 400kb
    * Types of keys
        * Simple (Partition) or Composite(Parition & Sort) Primary keys
    * Capacity Units
        * 1 WCU - 1 KB per second
        * 1 RCU - 4 KB per second
    * backups
        * On - Demand backup
        * restores
            * Same or Cross-region
            * 
        * PITR
            * Continous record upto 35 days
            * Can be resotred with 1 millisecond delay
    * Considerations 
        * NoSQL ... preference DynamoDB
        * Relational Data NOT DynamoDB
        * Key/Value preference DynamoDB
        * DynamoDB cannot be accessed via SQL only via CLI, SDK or Console
        * Billed on RCU,WCU, Storage and features
DynamoDB Performance, Consistency, Operations
    * R/W
        * On-Demamnd
            * unkonwn, unpredictiable , low admin
            * price per million R or W unites (5 times more than provisioned)
        * provisoned
            * RCU and WCU set ona per table basis
            * Every operation consumes at leat 1 RCU/WCU
            * 1 WCU - 1 KB per second
            * 1 RCU - 4 KB per second
        * Every table has a RCU and WCU burst pool (300 seconds)
    * Query
        * Query based on a partition key an /or sort key
    * Scan 
        * Moves through the entire table
        * Coonsumes based on the item scanned
    * Consistnecy
        * Clustered with one leader storage node
        * Writes are always directed to leader node
        * Eventual Consistency Read
            * Half the cost of strongly consistent
        * Strong Consistency
        * WCU Calculation
            *
